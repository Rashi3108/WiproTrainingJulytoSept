Shell Scripting Practice Questions
=========================================================

1. Check and Log Running Processes
----------------------------------
File Name: process_checker.sh

Problem:
- Search for processes related to a keyword like `nginx` or `java`.
- Log how many such processes are currently running.
- Append the output with a timestamp to a file called `process_log.txt`.

Bonus:
- Accept the process name as a command-line argument.


2. Disk Usage Reporter
----------------------
File Name: disk_check.sh

Problem:
- Check the disk usage of the root partition `/`.
- If the usage is more than 80%, show a **warning** on the screen.
- Otherwise, print “Disk usage normal”.
- Log the status with a timestamp into `disk_report.log`.


3. Find Large Files in a Directory
----------------------------------
File Name: large_files.sh

Problem:
- Find all files larger than 100MB in a directory (default: current directory).
- Sort them by size in descending order.
- Save the result in `large_files_report.txt`.

Bonus:
- Accept the directory path as an argument.


4. Simple Directory Backup Script
---------------------------------
File Name: backup_dir.sh

Problem:
- Take a directory name as input.
- Create a `.tar.gz` archive with the current date in the filename,
  e.g., `backup_etc_2025-08-08.tar.gz`.
- Save it in a folder called `backups/` (create it if it doesn't exist).


Covered Commands
----------------
- ps, grep, df, find, tar, du, sort, date, mkdir
- Redirection: >, >>
